# The Weight of Expectations

We carry expectations like stones in our pockets—expectations from others, expectations from ourselves, expectations from a future that hasn't happened yet. The weight grows heavier with each passing day.

I've spent years trying to meet these expectations, to be the person others want me to be, to achieve the things I'm supposed to achieve. But the more I try, the heavier the stones become, until I can barely move under their weight.

The problem is not the expectations themselves—it's that we never question them. We accept them as truth, as inevitability, as the only way forward. We forget that we can put the stones down, that we can choose which ones to carry and which ones to leave behind.

Learning to let go has been one of the hardest lessons of my life. It means disappointing people, falling short of my own standards, accepting that I can't be everything to everyone. But it also means freedom—the freedom to be myself, to follow my own path, to define success on my own terms.

The weight of expectations is real, but it's also optional. We can choose to carry it, or we can choose to set it down and walk lighter.
