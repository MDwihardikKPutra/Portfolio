# On Photography and Memory

Every photograph is a moment frozen in time, but what we capture is not the moment itself—it's our memory of it, filtered through the lens of our perception, our emotions, our expectations.

When I look at old photographs, I don't see the past as it was. I see it as I remember it, or as I wish it had been. The camera lies, not because it distorts reality, but because it can only capture a fragment—a single frame in an infinite sequence of moments.

Photography has taught me that memory is not a recording but a reconstruction. We don't remember events; we remember our last memory of them. Each time we recall something, we reshape it slightly, until the memory becomes more about how we feel about it than what actually happened.

This is both beautiful and terrifying. Beautiful because it means we can find meaning in our past, can shape our narrative. Terrifying because it means we can never truly return to a moment, can never experience it exactly as it was.

But perhaps that's the point. Perhaps the value of photography is not in preserving the past, but in creating a bridge between who we were and who we are becoming.
