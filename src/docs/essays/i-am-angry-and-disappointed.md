# I Am Angry and Disappointed as If I Have Many Choices

Riding home from work on the motorcycle I've used since high school, the bike knows every turn and pothole on the road. Even without my command, it will bring me home. I find myself sighing more often than paying attention to the road. It's a bad habit that's deeply ingrained.

Lately, this is what I constantly feel. It turns out that starting work can be this stressful; not the dramatic, conflicting kind of stress, but a silent one born from routine. Living through repetitive days, I feel like a headless person. My body moves automatically: wake up, shower, work, eat, sleep—like a robot programmed for a single, meaningless function.

But that's the only thing I can do right now. What else, really? I always thought that after the demanding years of school and college, I would find something "fun," "exciting," or "interesting" in the working world. There are no feelings whatsoever that can fulfill my right to be a complete human being.

A human without feelings is no different from Astro in Naoki Urasawa's series Pluto. I look at my face in the mirror; it behaves as if I'm human, smiling if necessary, nodding if required. But I know, if someone could detach the emotional chip in my skull, it could simply be replaced with a new one. All the emotions could even be refilled, as if this emptiness is just a bug that needs patching.

I try to escape, trying to fill this void with things that matter. Buying lots of books, reading lots of books—this activity has been somewhat entertaining lately. But ironically, it only sinks me deeper into things without emotion. I've become accustomed to analyzing my life, dissecting it completely, without ever truly feeling it. I need a rush of dopamine, not from books that make me think, but from experiences that make me feel.

I keep wishing that someday there will be a genius scientist who can detect what feeling is truly being felt when a person feels empty—an early warning signal, a detector—so I can take the medicine. But humans tend to realize it only when it's already severe, when the emptiness has permeated and feels cold.

All my anger over this repetitive routine, anger born from an unbearable saturation, makes me increasingly bitter, more cynical, and strangely, feel like I can conquer the world. That anger gives me the illusion of strength, the illusion that I am a caged lion ready to pounce.

I am angry, I am disappointed, and I act as if I have many choices in my hands.

Yet, when all the lights are off and I'm just staring at the bedroom ceiling, I know the truth. I know how limited my scope for movement is.

But do I really have many choices?
